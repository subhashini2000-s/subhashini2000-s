Task: Using the AdvancedArithmetic interface provided by Hacker Rank, take an integer n and return the sum of its divisors.


Unfortunately, this day offered no JavaScript practice so I went back to C# for it.

Process: Take n as a parameter of divisorSum method and first determine its divisors. This is accomplished by using a For loop from i=1 to n. In this loop it checks If n is divisible by i (when this is true the resulting integer is 0). If so, then iâ€™s value is added onto sum. When For statement has incremented all the way from 1 to n, it ends and returns sum.

SOLUTION(PYHTON)

class AdvancedArithmetic(object):
    def divisorSum(n):
        raise NotImplementedError

class Calculator(AdvancedArithmetic):
    def divisorSum(self, n):
        pass
        x = []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                x.append(i)
            else:
                pass
        return sum(x)


n = int(input())
my_calculator = Calculator()
s = my_calculator.divisorSum(n)
print("I implemented: " + type(my_calculator).__bases__[0].__name__)
print(s)
