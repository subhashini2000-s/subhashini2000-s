Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e. fine=0) .
If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, fine= 15 Hackos x number of days late.
If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine= 500Hackos x number of days late.
If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 Hackos

Sample Input
STDIN       Function
-----       --------
9 6 2015    day = 9, month = 6, year = 2015 (date returned)
6 6 2015    day = 6, month = 6, year = 2015 (date due)

Sample Output
45

SOLUTION(PYTHON)

rd, rm, ry = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
ed, em, ey = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

if (ry, rm, rd) <= (ey, em, ed):
    print(0)
elif (ry, rm) == (ey, em):
    print(15 * (rd - ed))
elif ry == ey:
    print(500 * (rm - em))
else:
    print(10000
