The first line has a double, mealCost(the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
The second line has an integer, tippercent(the percentage of  being added as tip).
The third line has an integer,  taxPrcent(the percentage of  being added as tax).

SOLUTION(PYTHON)

def solve(meal_cost, tip_percent, tax_percent):
     tip=meal_cost*(tip_percent/100)
     tax=meal_cost*(tax_percent/100)
     total_Cost=meal_cost+tip+tax
     print(round(total_Cost))
