Objective
Today, we’re building on our knowledge of Arrays by adding another dimension. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Context
Given a 2D Array, :

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
We define an hourglass in to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in ‘s graphical representation:

a b c
d
e f g
There are hourglasses in , and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass’ values.

Task
Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in , then print the maximum hourglass sum.

Input Format

There are lines of input, where each line contains space-separated integers describing 2D Array ; every value in will be in the inclusive range of to .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in .

Sample Input

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0
Sample Output

Explanation

contains the following hourglasses:

1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
1 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0

0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0
0 0 2 0 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 0

1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
0 2 4 4
0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0

0 0 2 0 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 0
0 0 2 0
0 0 1 0 1 2 1 2 4 2 4 0
The hourglass with the maximum sum () is:

2 4 4
2
1 2 4
