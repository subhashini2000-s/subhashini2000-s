Complete the Difference class by writing the following:
A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the elements instance variable.
A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any numbers in N and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.
'''

SOLUTION(PYTHON)

class Difference:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.__elements = a
        self.maximumDifference = 0
    
    def computeDifference(self):
        x = 101
        y = 0

        for item in self.__elements:
            if item < x:
                x = item
            if item > y:
                y = item
            

    
        self.maximumDifference = y - x 
        

	# Add your code here

# End of Difference class

_ = input()
a = [int(e) for e in input().split(' ')]

d = Difference(a)
d.computeDifference()

print(d.maximumDifference)
