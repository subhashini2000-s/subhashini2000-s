Objective 
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!
Task 
Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2).
Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation.
Input Format
A single integer,n.
Constraints
1<n<10**6
Output Format
Print a single base-2 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of n .
Sample Input 1
5
Sample Output 1
1
Sample Input 2
13
Sample Output 2
2
Explanation
Sample Case 1: 
The binary representation of 5 is 101 , so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1 .
Sample Case 2: 
The binary representation of 13 is 1101, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is2 .

SOLUTION(PYTHON)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n =int(input())
temp=0
s=""
rem=0
while(n>0):
      temp=int(n/2)
      rem=n%2
      s=s+str(rem)
      n=temp

length=0
count=0
one="1"
for i in range(len(s)):
      #to check the one 
    if(s[i]==one):
        count+=1
        #to update the length..
        if(count>length):
              length=count
    else:
           count=0
print(length)
