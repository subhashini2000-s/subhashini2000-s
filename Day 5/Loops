Find the Day 5 Loops Hackerrank Solution in C language. day 5 problem is dedicated to “Loop” in programming, we need to perform a task using “Loop“, as we all know there are basically 4 types of “Loop” in programming, first one is For Loop, the second one is While Loop(While-Do Loop), and the third one is Do-While Loop.

There is one more loop which is For-Each(Used in Java Programming) loop to know more about the visit to Stackoverflow, now come to the point we also have to find the Loops Hackerrank Solution in Java, C++, and C Programming language.

Day 5 Problem Statement
Given an integer,n, print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple n * i (where 1<=i<=10) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

Input Format
A single integer, n.

Constraints
2<=n<=20
Output Format
Print 10 lines of output; each line i(where 1<=i<=10) contains the result of n * i in the form: n x i = result.

Sample Input
2
Sample Output
2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6
2 x 4 = 8
2 x 5 = 10
2 x 6 = 12
2 x 7 = 14
2 x 8 = 16
2 x 9 = 18
2 x 10 = 20

SOLUTION (PYTHON)
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys



if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(1, 11):
        print(n, 'x', i, '=', n*i)
